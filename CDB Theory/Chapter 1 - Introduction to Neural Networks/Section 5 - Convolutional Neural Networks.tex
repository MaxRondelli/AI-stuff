\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning architecture commonly used in Computer Vision. 
CNN consists of multiple layers like the input layer, Convolutional layer, Pooling layer, and fully connected layers. 
The convolutional layer applies filter to the input imagine to extract features, the Pooling layer reduces the image in order to minimize computation,
and the fully connected layer makes the final prediction. The network learns the optimal filters through backpropagation and gradient descent.
