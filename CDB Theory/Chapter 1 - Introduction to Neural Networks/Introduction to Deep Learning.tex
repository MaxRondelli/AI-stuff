\chapter{Introduction to Deep Learning}
It seems logical to look at the brain's architecture for inspiration to build an intelligent machine. This is the logic that sparked artificial neural networks (ANN$_s$).
Machine learning models are inspired by the networks of biological neurons in our brains. ANN$_s$ are at the very core of deep learning. 
The first part of this chapter introduces artificial neural networks, starting with a quick visit to the very first ANN architectures and leading up to multilayer perceptrons, which are very used today.
