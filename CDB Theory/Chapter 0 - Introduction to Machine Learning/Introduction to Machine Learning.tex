\chapter{Introduction to Machine Learning}
Machine Learning (ML) is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data. The examples that the system uses to learn are called
training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample). The parte of a ML system that learns and makes prediction is called a model.
Neural networks and random forests are examples of models.

There are many different type of machine learning systems. It is useful to classify them in board categoreis based on the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How they are supervised during the learning
    \item Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online or batch learning)
    \item Whether they work by simply comparing how data points to known data points, or instead, detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive model
\end{itemize}
